# rental_car_strategy
This is the very first capstone project I did with Thinkful.

Scenario: I'm consulting as a data analyst for Lariat. They've hired me to make recommendations about how to make better decisions, which they measure in terms of the costs and revenue generated by their rental car fleet. I was provided 4 Excel worksheets of raw data to explore and analyze for business insights.

Project Deliverables: 
1. An Excel model that Lariat can use to make data-informed decisions about their fleet, based on the observed costs and revenue data from their fleet in recent years.
2. A PowerPoint deck that provides an analysis of the problem and recommendations.
3. A live presentation in which I present my findings to Lariat executives.

Applied Techniques & Methods:
- VLOOKUPs
- INDEX/MATCH
- Pivot Tables
- Data Validation
- Dashboarding
- Data Storytelling
